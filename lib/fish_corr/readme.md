# FishPy - Correlations

## What is this

This is the code I wrote for my PhD project in university of Bristol.

This is not meant to be used *easily* as I am the only contributer. I will work on making it more user-friendly but this is what I could do for now. Please [write me an email](mailto:yy17363@bristol.ac.uk?subject=Chatting%20about%20FishPy%20) if you are interested in anything related 3D tracking.

This package contains different correlations to characterise my fish, hopefully more active matter systems.


## How to use the code

### Install the package

First of all, add the **full path** of folder `FishPy` to the `PYTHONPATH`.

If you know what you are doing, you can also paste the folder to the `site-package` of the pyhton that you are using.

### Analysis

A *standard template* of using this can be found in [`Fishpy/script/auto_analysls`](../script/auto_analysis)
