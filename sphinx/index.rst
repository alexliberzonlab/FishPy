The Author
==========

Very unfortunately I wrote the entire package, quite often in a desperate manner. If you find anyting useful related to `FishPy <https://github.com/yangyushi/FishPy>`_ or to this documentation, you are making me very happy.

Anyway, this is my email: yushi.yang@bristol.ac.uk.

I even got a `website <https://yangyushi.github.io>`_.
